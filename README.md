# Price Predicting Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the price of an item based on specific features. The model is implemented using Python and utilizes scikit-learn for training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine with the following command:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/S-Hari-Prasad-Reddy/Price-Predicting-Model
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook:** Navigate to the cloned directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file (`price_predicting_model.ipynb`) using Google Colab. Click on this link to open the notebook: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/S-Hari-Prasad-Reddy/Price-Predicting-Model/blob/main/Price%20Predicting%20Model.ipynb).

3. **Run the Notebook:** Within Google Colab, execute each cell to delve into the data, preprocess it, construct the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## Contents

- **`data/`**: This directory includes the dataset (`ford.csv`) utilized for model training and testing.
- **`price_predicting_model.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code, covering data preprocessing, model construction, and assessment.
- **`README.md`**: This readme file provides an overview of the repository.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- Google Colab (for interactive notebook execution)

You can easily install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```
